# AoA-Bot
A discord bot designed to manage Pathfinder2e character data. Works with Pathbuilder2e webservice and it's JSON compatable services. 

# ChangeLog
(1/22/2025) added main_5e to use for D&D 5e games. Currently only has basic invocation-sharing features for a homebrew ruling. Also added invocations.json, though some of the descriptions are outdated following the 2024 5e update (its not a new edition, and I will die on this hill. Its barely an expansion, Tasha's had more content than this!!! Also what they did to the ranger is just... WHY!?)
